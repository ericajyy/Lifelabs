            <h2 class="background">Background of the story</h2>
            <br>
<h5> Story Setting</h5>
<br>
<p>The story takes place in Daxing, the capital city of the Sui Dynasty, located in modern-day Xi’an, China. This setting is during the early 7th century, a time when the Sui Dynasty was in the midst of major infrastructure projects likes the construction of the Grand Canal and enduring constant military campaigns. These endeavors placed immense pressure on the common people, leading to social unrest, which becomes a critical element in the story.</p>
<br>
       
        <br>
        <h5>Traditional Framework</h5>
        <br>
During the Sui Dynasty, the culture was deeply rooted in Confucianism, patriarchal values, and a strict social hierarchy. The family unit and societal order were structured around clearly defined gender roles, especially the role of women, who were expected to be subservient to men, manage household duties, and preserve family honor through obedience and virtue.

<br>
<h5>Storyboard</h5>
<br>
<p>Fei Lin, a talented woman in the Sui dynasty, feels trapped by strict gender roles. Her father arranges her marriage to Shi Wang, a conservative man. Although she excels in literature and philosophy she suppresses her intelligence to honor her family.

    While Shi Wang is away, Fei Lin learns about a rebellion led by shu xian against oppressive taxes and gender roles. Intrigued, she secretly joins the movement but her husband is tasked with suppressing it. When captured, Shi Wang confronts her, feeling betrayed. In his moment of anger, he takes her life.
    
    After her death the rebellion is crushed but Fei Lin’s sacrifice inspires many women to question their roles in society.

<h5>After Fei Lin's Tragic Ending</h5>
<br>
<p>Fei Lin at the end dies, but her death wasn't in vain; it made women at their time question their role in society which helped them to be recognized and respected.
</p>
<br>
<h5>A message of inspiration</h5>
<br>
<p>We should be allowed to voice out our opinion and to be treated appropriately regardless of our gender. We shouldn't fear what other people would think or what other people would say and ignore the negative comments.
