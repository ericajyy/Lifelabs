<aside><h2>Fei Lin</h2></aside>
<p>Fei Lin is a highly intelligent woman who has intentionally hidden her talents in things like literature and philosophy to preserve her family's honor, only showing her talents such as accomplishing household duties and executing her role as an obedient wife to Shi Wang to the public eye. As the story goes on, she eventually finds the courage to stand up to her husband and reveal her involvement with a revolutionary group. Even in the face of impending execution, she remained fearless and resolute, defying expectations and asserting her voice. Fei Lin is the main focus of the story and holds the important role of the main character.</p>
<br>
<section><h2>Shi Wang</h2></section>
<p>Shi Wang, described by Lin Hao as responsible and well-educated, hails from a noble family and embodies traditional conservative ideals. He has served the emperor as a soldier. As the story progresses, he later becomes an antagonist after being commissioned to execute a revolutionary group, which he later discovers includes his wife, Fei Lin. Despite this, he still executed all of them. Shi Wang holds somewhat an important role in the story as he is the husband of Fei Lin and ends up being the antagonist.
</p>
<br>
<article><h2>Shu Xian</h2></article>
<p>Shu Xian is a smart and mature woman who founded and led the revolutionary group of women who wanted to point out the excessive tax distributions despite knowing that women can not intervene in political issues. It may not be directly said but Shu Xian is also a courageous woman. Shu Xian brings a bit of importance in the story as she is the one to have led the revolt
</p>
<br>
<aside><h2>Yu Wei</h2></aside>
<p>Yu Wei is the friend of Fei Lin and is part of the revolutionary force group as well, she is the one to invite and get Fei Lin to join the revolt led by Shu Xian, which later on gives Fei Lin courage. Yu Wei somewhat holds an importance to the story—without her inviting Fei Lin herself, she would’ve most likely not joined the rebellion.
